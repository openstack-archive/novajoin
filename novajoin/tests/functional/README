The test_ipa_integration.py test needs to be executed against a live
installation of FreeIPA. It will look for a copy of the novajoin keytab in
/etc/novajoin/krb5.keytab or /tmp/test.keytab.

A new krb5.conf is included which will force the default ticket lifetime to
1 minute and time.sleep(60) is used to ensure an expiration will happen.

To run only the FreeIPA integration test, execute it as:

python -m unittest novajoin.tests.functional.test_ipa_integration

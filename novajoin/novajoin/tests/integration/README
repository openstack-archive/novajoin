Currently this test needs to be executed against a live installation with a copy
of the novajoin keytab in /tmp/test.keytab.

A new krb5.conf is included which will force the default ticket lifetime to 1 minute
and time.sleep(60) is used to ensure an expiration will happen.

I execute it as: nosetests -v novajoin/tests/integration/test_ipa.py
